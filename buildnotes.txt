update locale to en_US.UTF-8 as documented here:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Locale

basically edit /etc/locale.gen, then do 
> sudo locale-gen
> sudo localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8

vector 0.10.12.2 had a problem in Size.hs.  
got master from github, it built ok. vector-0.11.0.0.

ok installed vector-0.11.0.0 that compiles ok.  
compiled persistent-sqlite3 with that.  

compiling chordster fails though - it tries to use the old version of vector, 0.10.12.2, and that doesn't work.  I tried putting a depencence into chordster of 0.11.0.0 but that generates one million conflicts with yesod. 

from here:  download yesod, change vector lib dependence?

no, cabal test fails for persistent-sqlite with same error.  

ok, for persistent-sqlite, change the systemlib flag to true.  

flag systemlib
  description: Use the system-wide sqlite library
  default: True

If using a sandbox to build chordster, then do this:

chordster dir> cabal sandbox add-source ~/code/persistent/persistent-sqlte
 
I did a 'cabal install persistent-sqlite' (in chordster dir), but it might work to just do cabal install again.
